            Hey, friends Abhilash Jethuri here, I started my trading and investing
            journey since 2019. First, I read to many books on stock market and
            then entered in market but lose all my money with in 6 months, my
            initial fund was 10k and early in starting I invested in weak
            fundamental companies and lose my money because of insufficient
            knowledge, poor risk management and wrong position sizing.
            <hr />
            After losing continuously and so much of work and effort I become a
            profitable trader, now I am a breakout trader and an option buyer in
            nifty 50 Index.
            <hr />
            To explore my knowledge, I start on the way finance platform for
            sharing my knowledge for who need the most. Here you will also find
            written notes of video content and if you need more help your welcome,
            you can contact me by my E-mail or comment me in comment box, I will
            try to help you.
